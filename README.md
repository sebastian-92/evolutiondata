# The Hungry Games
The results and program from my science fair project for the 23-24 school year!
# What is what
The original program run in this experiment is the Predator and prey genetic 2.2 file. All the prey data is in the logprey.zip file. All .txts are spreadsheets in csv format. The prey full.txt file in logprey.zip is all the prey traits running, but none of the predators. All the predator data, and the full simulation data is in the log predator.zip file. All traits that are run alone are marked as that trait. The file that says log predator only is just the predator traits evolving
# How to run the program
To run this project, use [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com), and upload the .pmp file
# Other notes
The size attribute data from the original experiment means nothing, I made an error, but it shouldn't affect the other data.
I am probably going to go ffurther on this program and experiment.
This project took a lot of time to make, I hope you learned something, I definitely did.
